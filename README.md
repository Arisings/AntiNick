# AntiNick
Handy utility for detecting and denicking nicked players.

By default whenever a nicked player joins their presence will be automatically announced. Additionally, if they are using their real Minecraft skin (/nick skin real) they will be automatically denicked.

## Commands
`/nicklist` -- Display a list of all the nicked players in your lobby.
`/scan \<player>` -- Get an integrity analysis of a player to see how whether or not they fail nick detection tests.
`/getskininfo` \<player> -- Copies the NBT data of a player's skin to your clipboard.

## Coming soon??
- Automatic detection to see if a nick is automatically generated or manually picked (i.e. by a YouTuber or Staff member)
- More configurability (Config GUI)
- Denick caching
